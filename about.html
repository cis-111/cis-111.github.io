			<h2>ABOUT ME: 
				Renee Wendy</h2>
			<h3>A weird person who believes we are living in an extraordinarily lifelike simulation.</h3>
				
				<h3>I live in four different places, not on purpose.  </h3>
				I live in Mount Shasta.  But then Mom needed help so I live with her 1/2 time in Yuba City.  But Mom needed to move to be closer to Kaiser so I packed her up and now I live with her in Concord.  But I still ive in Yuba City as I am getting the house ready for renters.  And during the pandemic I "temporarily" moved to San Jose, and temporarily extended pandemically, and haven't gotten my stuff out of there yet.  So, four places. By accident. 

				<h3>Spend most of my ("time") meditating.</h3> Now the universe is looking out of these eyes.  The cat joins me in contemplating the subtle difference between 'breeze' and 'wind'. Many gifts are offered every minute of the day, thanks to Eternal Harmony.  Still, I personally worry about the political situation and the zeal of the mountain militia.
				
				<h3>I wish I had done a better job with this portfolio.<Br>
								
				<h3>Time is perplexing.</h3>
